Code Structure:
The class minimax performs the decision making. Contains decision making function which returns minimax's decision, max value function which performs maximizing operations, minimum value function perfoms minimizing operations, utility function returns the utility that needs to be maximized or minimized. Result function calculates the new state after a particular move and possible moves funtion returns the moves that are possible.

Compilation and execution:
If both python2 and python3 are installed, run the following for one move mode:
	py -2 maxconnect4.py one-move [input_file] [output_file] [depth]
otherwise run:
	python maxconnect4.py one-move [input_file] [output_file] [depth]

For interactive mode, pass the following arguments:
	python maxconnect4.py interactive [input_file] [computer-next/human-next] [depth]
or	py -2 maxconnect4.py interactive [input_file] [computer-next/human-next] [depth]


**The program has been implemented with depth limt and alpha-beta. So, it can be entered into a tournament.
