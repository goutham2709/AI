Code Structure:
Class compute_a_posteriori
This class implements a system that (a)Can determine the posterior probability of different hypotheses, given priors for these hypotheses, and given a sequence of observations. (b)Can determine the probability that the next observation will be of a specific type, priors for different hypotheses, and given a sequence of observations.

Class bnet
This class implements a program that computes and prints out the probability of any combination of events given a Bayesian network, establishing relations between events on the burglary-earthquake-alarm domain together with complete specifications of all probability distributions.

Task 2 Functions: 
This function calls computeProbability function to compute the probability by considering different combination of values for the missing elements in the numerator and denominitor.
